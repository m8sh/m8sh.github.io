    <h1>Will's Learning Blog & Writeups</h1>
    <p>I'm going to use these pages as a place to record my learning progress, to create writeups for projects and solutions I do, to reflect on my progress, 
      and to keep myself accountable, because even if I'm positng into the void, it feels a lot more impactful to say stuff that someone else might end up reading.
      I'm going to try to post here at least once a week to showcase my progress on whatever project I'm working on.
